# unixlib
UNIX C standard library replacement created for Hacktoberfest

This library consists of replacement for simple everyday C standard functions. It mainly focuses on getting rid of the error-checking/cross platform features to reduce the functions to small pieces of understandable code which easily fit in one source file.

While most of the functions look like exact copies in how they work of the standard functions, they are not and the programming mindset in this project is to simply provide a lightweight library which does what you want it to. No abstraction.
